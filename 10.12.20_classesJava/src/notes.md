Everything in java is contained in a class
-EXCEPT PRIMITIVE TYPES: they will have no definition

when working with "types" use alligator brackets <>

new ArrayList<String>()
^this is an instructor

for later> instantiation an object of the class
ArrayList<String> thisIsMyVariable = new ArrayList<String>();
thisIsMyVariableName

Null Value
- literal type
- means nothing
