1. Build out the file paths in the image. Your root directory (folder) will be the highlighted word **directories. Every highlighted word is a new directory(folder) and the non-highlighted words are plain old files.** 
done

2. If I start in my root directory (in this case it is called directories). How would I navigate to the directory called food?
cd images\clipart\food

3. From food, how would I navigate to Poe, EdgarAllen?
cd\
cd Java_Work\directories\e-texts\Poe_EdgarAllen

4. How would I be able to tell the contents of Poe, EdgarAllen?
dir

5. Navigate to images, and use the command that will tell you the exact path of where you are.
 
6. While in images, create a folder called photographs.
mkdir photographs

7. Navigate to your new directory, and create a new file called sunrise. Oh, and make it a .jpg file. (Windows get a freebie here).
cd photographs
null>> sunrise.jpg

8. Now move that file back one directory.
move sunrise.jpg ../images

9. Change directories to the like folder under monkeys. Open this folder in sublime. 
cd/
cd Java_Work\directories\monkeys\like
subl.exe like

10. Bonus! Remove the bananas.html file from the like folder.
rmdir /S "bananas.html"
